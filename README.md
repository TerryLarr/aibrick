# Lego AI

Simple project for controlling Lego Bluetooth Hubs using Artificial Inteligence algorithms on smarthone. 
* Processing is performed in web browser using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and [speech-commands.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/speech-commands) library for speech recognition. 
* Communication with Lego Bluetooth Hubs uses [WebBluetoothAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to establish Nordic UART connection (code based on [web-device-cli](https://github.com/makerdiary/web-device-cli)
* Communication processing on Lego Hub was implemented in [Pybrick](https://pybricks.com/)
